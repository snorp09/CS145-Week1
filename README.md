# CS &145 Lab 1 - OOP
For this assignment, we based our code upon the Exercise09_13 assignment in the module
Translating it into a more object oriented style using the three classes.

The code is found in src/Location/Location.java

## For Extra Credit:
- We put all our classes into one file using the "package" keyword.
- I translated the project into the C Language. See Location.c at the top level of this repo.
